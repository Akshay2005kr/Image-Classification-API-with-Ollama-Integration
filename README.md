# Image-Classification-API-with-Ollama-Integration
Image Classification API with Ollama Integration is a Flask-based application that allows users to upload an image and receive AI-generated classification results. The API sends the image to an Ollama local vision model, processes it, and returns detected objects and descriptions in JSON format—fast, secure, and fully offline.
